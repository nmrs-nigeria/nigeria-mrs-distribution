These are distinctive disorders identifiable on the basis of a typical age onset, specific EEG characteristics, seizure types, and often other features which, when taken together, permit a specific diagnosis.  The diagnosis in turn often has implications for treatment, management, and prognosis. The term for these entities is “Electro-clinical Syndromes.”  While ultimately common usage will likely shorten the term again to “syndrome” alone, this is still specifically defined to mean entities that can be considered electro-clinical syndromes.
